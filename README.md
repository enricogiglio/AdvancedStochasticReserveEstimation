# AdvancedStochasticReserveEstimation
This repository implements a stochastic reserve estimation model for power systems. It simulates up/down reserve needs considering outages, load and RES uncertainty, and ramping limits. Sobol sequences and Monte Carlo simulation are used to derive reserve estimates in line with ENTSO-E guidelines.


# Collaboration
These codes were developed in collaboration with @davide-f and @edopasta
